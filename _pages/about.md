I am a a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where I focus on developing robust, trustworthy multimodal and vision-language models that can withstand adversarial manipulation, backdooring, and misinformation attacks. My research spans adversarial robustness, multimodal alignment, secure fine-tuning, and safety evaluation in foundation models, with the broader goal of ensuring reliability and ethical deployment of AI at scale. 

My recent work proposes defense strategies against multimodal poisoning attacks, designs universal perturbations for multi-image tasks, and builds fine-grained inconsistency detection systems capable of analyzing visual-textual contradictions in multimedia content. I also explore vulnerabilities and probing techniques in emerging web agents, as well as imperceptible adversarial signals for audio-vision systems. 

I interned at GE Healthcare (2024), where I helped build one of the largest medical image-text datasets (2M pairs) across CT, MR, and ultrasound modalities, and contributed to designing a state-of-the-art multimodal medical foundation model. In 2025, I joined Futurewei Technologies as a research intern to develop self-evolving RAG architectures and reference-free hallucination mitigation frameworks for enterprise applications.
